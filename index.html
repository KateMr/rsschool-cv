            <h2>About myself</h2>
            <p>I am proud to be openminded and that I am always eager to discuss problems 
                in order to find the solution. I think it is always better to give some 
                light on a problem than just ignore it. </p>
            <p>Right now I am passionately studying to be a Front-end Developer. I 
                used to learn HTML and CSS back when I was in college, where I made 
                3 web-pages with basic functions and styles. When I was in university,
                I helped my mother with her business-pages in <a href="https://taplink.cc/psihologsv">Taplink</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Now I want to learn HTML and CSS deeper and also jump into JS.</p>
